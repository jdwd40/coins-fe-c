# Project Breakdown: 🛠️ Frontend Redesign for Coins App

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
**Vite.js, React, Chakra UI for styling**

## 🌎 Sprint 1: Project Setup & 💸 Coin Listing Page
**⏳ Duration**: 1 week

- **🛠️ Task 1.1: Vite.js Setup**
  - 🆕 Initialize Vite.js for the front-end project. This will help ensure faster builds and efficient development.
  - 🌱 Integrate Chakra UI to support theming and styling components, making it easy to create a consistent look throughout the application with minimal effort.

- **🛠️ Task 1.2: Component Structure & Routing**
  - 🗂️ Create a project folder structure for scalability (components, pages, services). This structure should be flexible and scalable, allowing for easy expansion as the project grows.
  - 🚻 Set up React Router to handle navigation between pages, including creating routes for each page such as the coin listing, coin details, login, and portfolio.

- **🛠️ Task 1.3: 💸 Coin Listing Page**
  - 🌄 Develop the main landing page for displaying the list of 💸 coins. Each coin should have its own card or list item, providing a summary of its key details.
  - 🌱 Use Chakra UI components to style the page, ensuring the page looks clean and professional. Use pre-built components like boxes, grids, and buttons for quick styling.
  - 📦 Fetch coins data from the backend API (`/api/coins`) and display coin name, symbol, current price, and supply. Ensure data is dynamically updated and displayed in real-time.
  - 🔙 Add a clickable link/button to view coin details, allowing users to navigate to a dedicated page with more information about each specific coin.

## 🌎 Sprint 2: Coin Details & 📈 Price History Chart
**⏳ Duration**: 1 week

- **🛠️ Task 2.1: 💸 Coin Details Page**
  - 🛍️ Create a new page that shows detailed information for a specific 💸 coin when clicked. Include data such as market cap, price history, and other relevant statistics.
  - 📦 Use the endpoint `/api/coins/:coinId` to fetch additional details, ensuring the data is relevant to the selected coin. Provide a fallback message in case the data fails to load.
  - 🌱 Use Chakra UI components to display data in an easy-to-digest layout. Utilize card or grid layouts to make the information visually appealing and organized.

- **🛠️ Task 2.2: 📈 Price History Chart**
  - 💻 Integrate a charting library (e.g., Chart.js or Recharts) to show price history. The chart should be easy to read and visually represent trends over time.
  - 📦 Fetch price history data using the endpoint `/api/coins/:coinId/price-history`. Ensure that data points are correctly plotted and can represent time periods like daily, weekly, or monthly trends.
  - 📈 Implement a line chart to represent the price trend over time, with labeled axes for easy interpretation. Allow users to hover over the chart to see exact price values at specific points in time.

## 🌎 Sprint 3: User 👤 Authentication & Profile Management
**⏳ Duration**: 1.5 weeks

- **🛠️ Task 3.1: 🔑 Authentication Setup**
  - 🗒️ Create login and register forms using Chakra UI. Make use of form components for fields like email, username, and password, and validate inputs to ensure data accuracy.
  - 📦 Connect to the backend API for user registration (`/api/users/register`) and login (`/api/users/login`). Handle API errors gracefully, showing appropriate error messages if registration or login fails.
  - 💎 Use JWT tokens to manage authentication state, ensuring users remain logged in between sessions. Store tokens securely using local storage or session storage.

- **🛠️ Task 3.2: Protect User-Specific Routes**
  - 🛍️ Implement private routes for pages like the portfolio and buying/selling 💸 coins. Protect these pages so that only logged-in users can access them.
  - 🚪 Redirect unauthenticated users to the login page, prompting them to authenticate before accessing user-specific content. Provide clear feedback so users understand why they were redirected.

- **🛠️ Task 3.3: User Profile Page**
  - 👤 Create a user profile page to allow viewing and updating user data. Include fields for personal information, email, and preferences.
  - 📦 Use the `/api/users/:userId` endpoint for fetching and updating profile information. Ensure users can easily edit and save changes, with validation to prevent incorrect input.

## 🌎 Sprint 4: Portfolio & Transactions
**⏳ Duration**: 1.5 weeks

- **🛠️ Task 4.1: User 💸 Portfolio Page**
  - 📃 Develop a page to show a list of 💸 coins that the user owns, along with details such as quantity, average purchase price, and total value.
  - 📦 Fetch user portfolio data from `/api/portfolio/:userId`. Ensure the data is always up-to-date and reflects the latest transactions.
  - 🌱 Display holdings using Chakra UI components, using grid or table layouts for easy viewing. Provide visual indicators for profits or losses on each coin.

- **🛠️ Task 4.2: 💸 Buy/Sell Coin Actions**
  - 🔗 Create buttons for buying or selling 💸 coins on the coin details page. Clearly label the buttons to avoid confusion.
  - 🗒️ Implement forms to specify buy/sell amounts. Validate user input to ensure they enter correct values, and prevent buying more than available funds or selling more than owned coins.
  - 📦 Use the `/api/transactions` endpoint to perform buy/sell actions. Provide users with instant feedback on the transaction status, including success, failure, or pending.

- **🛠️ Task 4.3: 💳 Transaction History**
  - 📜 Add a section to the profile or portfolio page to display transaction history. Include details like transaction type (buy/sell), amount, date, and value.
  - 📦 Fetch data from `/api/transactions/:userId` and present it in a tabular format. Include filters for date ranges, coin type, and transaction type to help users easily find specific transactions.

## 🌎 Sprint 5: UI Enhancements & 🛁 Final Touches
**⏳ Duration**: 1 week

- **🛠️ Task 5.1: General UI Enhancements**
  - 💡 Refine the look and feel of each page using Chakra UI themes and custom components. Introduce consistent styling across pages, and use animations for smoother user interactions.
  - ⌛ Add loading spinners, error messages, and confirmation modals where needed. This will provide users with clear feedback when data is being fetched or when an action is performed.

- **🛠️ Task 5.2: 📱 Responsive Design**
  - 📲 Ensure the app is mobile-friendly by optimizing layouts for different devices. Use media queries and responsive components to adapt to different screen sizes.
  - 🛍️ Test and adjust UI components for different screen sizes, ensuring buttons are easy to click, text is readable, and charts are viewable on smaller devices.

- **🛠️ Task 5.3: 🛠 Testing & Bug Fixes**
  - 🔧 Conduct manual testing of each page and feature, verifying that all core functionality works as intended. Create a checklist to ensure no part of the app is overlooked.
  - 💡 Fix any bugs related to routing, data fetching, or UI interactions. Perform regression testing after fixes to ensure new changes do not break existing functionality.
